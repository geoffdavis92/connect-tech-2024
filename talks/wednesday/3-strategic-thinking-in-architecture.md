* Wardley mapping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map)
  * Example using Emmersion map
  * Helps us understand strategic landscape we're working in
  * map = symbolic depiction
  * Remember the audience for the map
  * Example: chart (y= value chain, x=evolution/commoditization)
    * Anchor at top
    * Capabilities below
  * Having user as anchor is useful
  * Examples of commoditization:
    * Activities (genesis->commodity)
    * Practice
  * Concepts
    * Things evolve (ex: charge a phone from custom-built -> product (charging station) -> commodity (direct outlet plug))
      * How does the chart change when specific items involve?
        * items move to the right (in given examples)
      * Inertia (represented on chart)
    * Components can co-evolve
      * Example: Architecture vs compute
  * How is this useful?
    * Understand the "why" better
    * Shared understanding
  * Example: JavaScript framework in Evolution, not Custom-Built
* Climate
  * external forces
  * broader rules of the game
  * patterns of seasons
  * competitor's actions
  * "No single method fits all"
  * Build/buy/partner/open source
    * ex: build software, partner for network access/cell service/etc
* Purpose-alignment model
  * Overlaps with Wardley mapping
